***Pinboard***

Visualise your goals with an inspiration board. Search and choose images to "pin" and save them to a board with a title.

Update: This is a project I originally built for my final project at Flatiron School in 2019. I have since refactored the code and added new features. I am currently working on a new version of this project with a new design and additional features. If I was building this from scratch, I would use a different stack and architecture. I am keeping this project up as a RoR portfolio piece and to show my progress as a developer.
