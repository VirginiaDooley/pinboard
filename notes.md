App
-NavBar
 -SearchContainer
  -SearchResults
 -BoardContainer
  -BoardList
  -ShowBoard

  redirect to show board

  when i click link from index, board is empty

  boardImages can be local; would this solve mapping issue on component did mount? if so, move boardImages state to board container and don't include on initial state?

  create functional component for board page and render board list and board show there?

  what else for show?

  what else for project specs?

  what exactly is set boards action doing?
