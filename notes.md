**REACT**
App
-NavBar
 -SearchContainer
  -SearchResults
 -CreateBoard
  -BoardList
  -ShowBoard

  Issues:

    can't access board show without going to index link first. Should I add lifecycle method?

    as time allows, figure out board show redirect after save

    just show boardslist component in that route

    diff url for production and DEVELOPMENT?

  what else for project specs?
    finish README
    blog and video
    deploy to heroku, as time allows
<!--

  fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/v1/boards', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify(board),
      headers: {â€¨
        'Accept': 'application/json',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    })
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(newBoard => {debugger})
    .catch(error => {
        console.log(error);
        alert("Board save failed, please try again!");
    })
  this.props.history.push(`/boards/${board.id}`)
}
